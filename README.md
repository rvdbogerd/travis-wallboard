# travis-wallboard
Wallboard for travis.

Features still being added but at this moment it is possible to see builds for all your travis projects in once (will show all non pull request branches)
Or will show the last x builds for a single project.

At first use you will be prompted for a repo id.

https://magnum.travis-ci.com/repoid/slugid

and your travis token
!!IMPORTANT this is an api token not the one you can find in your settings. See below for more details.

You can also skip them and add them trough the settings screen.

Settings will allow you to generate your travis token from a github token.
See the documentation at http://docs.travis-ci.com/api/#with-a-github-token to see what your token needs.
